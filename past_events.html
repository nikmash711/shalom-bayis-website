            Problems With Our Kids (and what to do about them) 
          </p>
          <p>
            Still on zoom due to the pandemic, it was decided to adopt a change to the usual format.  Firstly, this was our first session dealing with children.  Secondly, a panel of three experts - Dr. Ernest Katz, a seasoned clinical psychologist, Mrs. Annie Statman, a school counselor and private practitioner, and Rabbi Dr. Chaim Tureff, a school administrator all offered their thoughts on a variety of questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Katz put forth that the Torah gives us  a structure for life.  He likened our brains to the body's hardware and the Torah to the software that gives us a chance to use the hardware.  The Torah lays out the challenges that the forefathers and mothers faced.  We, too, face challenges and must give our children the ability to cope.  Dr. Katz emphasized that we must elevate physical things in this world to a spiritual level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Statman emphasized that parents are models for each other, their children and the community.  She spoke at length about dealing with anxiety in children and how to get them through a crisis together.  Allegorically, Mrs. Statman likened the "tablet" in our phones as our new tablets from Mt. Sinai.  Without proper guidance, using the internet is as dangerous as driving a car before you are ready.  It is a useful tool that must be used correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Tureff related that the concept of honoring one's parents should be taught in schools as well as at home.  He also addressed the causes and treatments of various addictions that affect many children.  As Dr. Katz and Mrs. Statman also pointed out, Rabbi Tureff stated that parents are not their children's "buddies", but rather their mentors.  To that thought, sometimes children want to spend time with their parents instead of a device.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, each expert responded with wisdom to the questions posed to them.  Here is a copy of the video presentation for your viewing pleasure.

          <p class="bold">
            Pandemic and Partnership:  Unlocking The Power Of Marriage In The Midst Of Turbulent Times 
          </p>
          <p>
            The year 2021 brought in a continuation of the COVD-19 pandemic, but we were able to use the power of zoom lecture to bring in Rabbi Shmuel Silber.  Rabbi Silber is the rav at Suburban Orthodox Congregation Toras Chaim of Baltimore, a large synagogue with over 400 families.  As such, Rabbi Silber is quite familiar with family issues and the topic of shalom bayis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, in defining the words "shalom bayis", Rabbi Silber used a series of biblical passages to illustrate the real meaning of those words.  People tend to define shalom bayis as the absence of conflict.  Not so, points out Rabbi Silber, as the Torah chronicles conflicts between Adam and Chava (Eve), Avraham and Sarah, Yitzchok and Rivka and Yaakov and Rachel.  Each of these special and holy couples experienced areas of conflict, such as Avraham having to banish his son Yishmael from the home at Sarah's direction.  This particular conflict was so intense that Hashem himself had to speak to Avraham to listen to his wife in the matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Silber offered three ways to deal with marital conflict.  First, acknowledge that husband and wife look at the world through two different but equal windows.  Instead of convincing your spouse that you are correct, try to understand the window through which they are viewing life.  Truth in marriage is subjective, not objective.  This is illustrated beautifully in the Gemara in Bava Metziah which states that "if your wife is short, bend down to speak to her."  In other words, don't expect your wife to stand on a chair to hear you, but rather you should try to speak to her on her own level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, in a moment of failure, don't forget all of the accomplishments that your spouse has done.  Contextualize conflict so that it is just an isolated event in an otherwise beautiful marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, in order to have true shalom bayis, work on yourself.  Self actualize.  Being in a good spiritual state, via learning or prayer, will put you in a good mental state to deal with your marriage and with life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Silber did emphasize that marital therapy can be quite helpful when needed. Although rabbis can be a first line of airing the problems of marriage, long term solutions are best handled through professional marriage counselors.
          </p>

            New Year's Resolutions For Our Marriages
          </p>
          <p>
            As the world continued to be paralyzed by the COVIC-19 pandemic,
            once again we turned to an online lecture instead of an in-person
            one. Our guest speaker, Yael Kaisman, chimed in from New Jersey to
            deliver a pre-high holy day lecture on the topic of shalom bayis.
            Mrs. Kaisman, who has taught at Bruria High School for Girls for
            forty years, also brought her experience of being a life coach and a
            frequent lecturer at Sinai and Heritage retreats.
          </p>
          <p>
            The month preceding the high holy days, Elul, is personified by its
            Hebrew letters, which form the first letters of the words “ani
            l’dodi v’dodi li”, “I am to my beloved and my beloved to me.” This
            phrase from Shir Hasirim is used to convey the dual love between the
            Jewish nation and Hashem as well as the love between spouses. So
            strengthening the marital bond at this time of year is more than
            appropriate!
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Kaisman focused her talk on how to build strong relationships.
            She began by pointing out that the Hebrew word for betrothal is
            “Nisuin”, which literally means to carry. Marriage means carrying
            the load – to have the ability to cope and tolerate the differences
            that may arise between spouses. Healthy communication is the key to
            a solid relationship. Speaking in a threatening or demeaning tone is
            counterproductive. When there is compassion and understanding, it is
            a lot easier to smooth out the differences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing one’s nature is a difficult proposition. Part of that
            process is to acknowledge our own mistakes. And, yes, a full apology
            goes a long way. Not a partial, “I’m sorry, but…”, rather a sincere
            effort to change our ways. For, after all, isn’t that what teshuva
            is all about? Mrs. Kaisman urged everyone not to shut down the
            “giving” from their spouse. Recognize and appreciate the good.
            Express it to your spouse. We are all quick to criticize. Are we as
            quick to praise? Finally, she reminded us not to take what our
            spouses do for granted. Hard work, be it in the home or outside of
            the home, should be properly noted and appreciated.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, the hour long lecture was peppered with wise advice,
            especially coming from someone whose mother was a therapist herself!
            The talk put everyone in the proper mood to develop the correct
            embodiment of “ani l’dodi v’dodi li”. A recording of the lecture can
            be found underneath.

          <p class="bold">Parenting Under Quarantine</p>
          <p>
            The unfortunate circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to a
            lockdown in most states. During this time, it was impossible to have
            a lecture attended by people, so we took to the internet to connect
            everyone with a Zoom lecture on how to properly parent under
            quarantine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being with each other 24/7 presents unique challenges for both
            parents and children. The shalom bayis framework is greatly
            challenged under these conditions. Thus, our guest lecturer,
            Yocheved Gouhari LCSW, an experienced therapist from Valley Village,
            shed some light on how to deal with the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            She began her interactive talk with a story of how her family was
            once trapped in an elevator for several hours. Rather than
            panicking, Mrs. Gouhari engaged her small children with entertaining
            games to make the most of the situation. It was a very telling story
            that gave a perspective on how to react to quarantine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Gouhari then gave an informative slide show on different
            principles of parenting. When under lockdown, determine how much
            exposure you want the children to have to media and information. Too
            much exposure to frightening images of COVID-19 disasters can
            instill fear into children who do not know how to process the
            information. Additionally, the dangers of the internet lurk in every
            computer, and extra time can lead to inappropriate viewings.
            Generally speaking, less is more, and limits must be set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making time for each individual child is important so that everyone
            feels special in their own way. And chores are important!! Chores
            instill a sense of responsibility and accomplishment in children. It
            also helps the parents around the house as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lively interactive question and answer period followed with topics
            ranging from making your own summer camp, how to limit
            internet/video game playing, and special needs of single parents.
            There were many "thank yous" after the session.

          <h2>February 2020</h2>
          <p class="bold">
            Rabbi Lazer Brody comes in from Israel for an extended weekend
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Lazer Brody, famed translator of the Garden of Emunah and
            Garden of Peace series and a prolific author and speaker, arrived in
            Los Angeles to spread the ideology of putting our faith in G-d.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Brody graced the Los Angeles community with a plethora of
            uplifting lectures. Although he was only here for 4 days, Rabbi
            Brody was able to spread his message in multiple venues. Beginning
            with a kumzitz on Thursday night February 20th at Maayon Torah on La
            Brea, Rabbi Brody brought people together with song and spirit. He
            followed up that performance with an entire Shabbaton at
            Congregation Mogen David on Pico Blvd. The Friday night dinner was
            sold out, and many people were unfortunately turned away due to lack
            of space. He addressed the 150 attendees who stayed up past 10:00
            p.m. to hear his stirring call to have total emunah in Hashem. Rabbi
            Brody gave a blessing to the many singles who attended, many of whom
            met individually with him after the meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Shabbos day, Rabbi Brody delivered the drasha at Mogen David and
            capped the evening with a speech to 175 men and women at Nessah
            Synagogue. Describing himself as an “emunologist”, Rabbi Brody
            punctuated his lecture with jokes and serious stories. He
            re-iterated his plea to put away the cell phones and begin sincere
            communication with your spouse and children. Quoting Rabbi Shimon
            bar Yochai, Rabbi Brody stated that Hashem wants your heart.
            Connection is the key, to both Hashem and your family. Rabbi Brody
            related some of the places around the world that he has spoken
            including Africa, Singapore and England. One non-Jewish woman in
            South Dakota was mesmerized by his tapes and began corresponding
            with Rabbi Brody. In fact, he related his speech to a non-Jewish
            audience in Wales in June of 2019 on the topic of the seven Noahite
            laws. As with the Friday night lecture, people stayed until 10:30
            p.m. receiving blessings and guidance from Rabbi Brody after the
            talk was over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunday was a lecture in the Valley followed by a talk at the home of
            Michael Isenberg to a group of 50 baalei teshuva. Once again, Rabbi
            Brody stressed the importance of communicating with your spouse and
            indicating what makes you happy or sad. After all, neither men nor
            women are mind readers!
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, it was an action packed weekend filled with song,
            inspiration, levity and direction. We would like to thank Junity
            founder Ariel Perets who partnered with us on bringing in Rabbi
            Brody. Yasher koach to Ariel for all of the good work that he does
            for our community.

          <h2>November 2019</h2>
          <p class="bold">Tools and Tips from the Wisdom of Torah</p>
          <p>
            Tools and Tips from the Wisdom of Torah was the theme of the
            November 20019 shalom bayis lectures. Once again, Nessah Synagogue
            in Beverly Hills provided the perfect setting for the talks. Rabbi
            Dov Heller, a long time Aish Hatorah rabbi as well as a practicing
            psychologist in the Pico-Robertson area, drew from his religious and
            professional background to deliver a very riveting talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Heller stressed practical ways to look at one’s self and one’s
            relationship with their spouse. For example, he urged the attendees
            to leave their work stress at work and unwind for a couple of
            minutes before walking through the front door. Quoting halachic
            sources such as the Ramchal (Rabbi Chaim Luzzatto), Rabbi Heller
            emphasized the need to avoid giving pain to others. This takes some
            self-evaluation of one’s attitudes, which he recommended that we all
            should do from time to time. At times funny, yet always on target,
            Rabbi Heller provided the attendees with a worksheet outlining his
            points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michal Horowitz flew in from the Five Towns area of New York to
            address the women. She delivered as inspirational and moving lecture
            that was peppered with personal stories and halachic wisdom. Using
            examples from the Torah regarding Adam and Chava as well as Moshe
            Rabbeinu, Mrs. Horowitz pointed out that one can be together with
            another person but still feel alone. It is incumbent upon us to
            develop a level of communication that engages our spouses instead of
            merely going through the motions of marriage. Mrs. Horowitz used
            anecdotes ranging from Reb Chaim Kanievsky to Rashi to Charlie
            Harary to illustrate her talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Valley lectures were hosted by Congregation Shaarei Zedek. As
            she did in Beverly Hills, Michal Horowitz addressed an enthusiastic
            crowd followed by questions and answers. Rabbi Jonathan Rosenberg,
            rav of Shaarei Zedek, delivered a thoughtful and in depth halachic
            discourse to the men.

          <h2>July 2019</h2>
          <p class="bold">Intimacy: Re-ignite the Spark Within</p>
          <p>
            Once again, hundreds of people flocked to hear two speakers on the
            topic of: Intimacy – Re-ignite the spark within. Those who came were
            not disappointed. Both Rabbi Avraham Peretz Friedman and Rebbetzin
            Sarah Karmely delivered informative lectures that addressed a wide
            variety of issues on the subject. Rabbi Friedman, author of the book
            Marital Intimacy, began his presentation by providing the Torah
            perspective on intimacy, replete with multiple sources from our
            sages. The Torah views intimacy as a mitzvah that is to be enjoyed,
            not shunned. His audiences in the Valley and at Nessah Synagogue in
            Beverly Hills were not just attentive during the talk, but engaged
            in active discussions afterwards as well. Many of the participants
            purchased Rabbi Friedman’s book as a guide to further their own
            personal shalom bayis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Karmely was quite an active speaker, speaking at SIX different
            locations during her stay in Los Angeles! As with Rabbi Friedman,
            the audiences were attached to every word, followed by extensive
            question and answer periods. Her answers were practical and useful,
            not just theoretical. Additionally, she emphasized the role of
            mikveh in women’s lives and the value that it adds to the intimate
            relationship. Mrs. Karmely also graciously arranged for multiple
            one-on-one sessions during her stay in Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The speakers were in such demand that many participants sought to be
            in touch with them in the coming months. MyShalomBayis is proud to
            sponsor eloquent speakers on such a sensitive and personal subject
            who are able to address issues with dignity and a true Torah
            perspective in a practical manner.

          <h2>May 2019</h2>
          <p class="bold">Great Ways to Have a Great Marriage</p>
          <p>
            Spring ushered in a new set of lectures by two very different
            speakers. The Valley venue also changed, as Azzi and ALia Silkoff
            hosted the event for the first time in their home. On Sunday morning
            May 12, Rivka Malka Perlman of Baltimore spoke to the Valley women
            in a very spirited and well received lecture. Mrs. Perlman, whose
            background is in the field of kiruv, currently serves as a life
            coach. She spoke of unconditional love and acceptance of each
            other's shortcomings in life. No man, no woman is perfect, nor
            should one be expected to be so. Emunah is a key factor in
            sustaining a marriage, guided by the realization that we must grow
            spiritually. Mrs. Perlman gave examples of her own life and how she
            and her husband handled certain situations that were thrust upon
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Perlman repeated her lecture on Monday night May 13 at Nessah
            Synagogue to a packed audience of women. Many people stayed
            afterwards for chizuk and blessings from the speaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Efraim Stauber came in from Israel to speak to the Valley men
            on Monday night May 13 at the Silkoff home. Rabbi Stauber, who lives
            in Givat Ze'ev, is very involved with couples as a marriage
            counselor. He also engages people in his new online eKehilla.com
            with divrei torah and a spirited exchange of ideas from members of
            the online group. One of the more humorous and enlightening examples
            that Rabbi Stauber presented was a case of a woman who gives a long
            speech of flowering praise to her husband before asking him to take
            out the garbage. Any man, he intimated, would do that for their wife
            after such a rousing ego-building preamble. It should be understood,
            stated Rabbi Stauber, that every time a wife asks her husband to do
            something for her, that she is giving over that same flowering
            praise without saying it directly. A man should be honored to
            provide for his wife in any arena.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Stauber's Tuesday night lecture at Nessah Synagogue followed
            the same course which was followed by everyone davening maariv
            together and multiple one-on-one consultations afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            2019 is off to a great start with hundreds more people dedicating
            themselves to strengthening their shalom bayis and that of the
            community at large.

          <h2>November 2018</h2>
          <p class="bold">Three Ways Of Keeping Your Love Alive</p>
          <p>
            Early November ushered in a bit of fall weather. With the chill came
            a pair of warm lectures on the topic of "Three ways to keep your
            love alive". Jackie Bitton, a girls' school principal in New York
            and a featured Ohr Naava speaker, gave a spirited talk to the women.
            The overwhelming theme was the way one should show empathy for their
            spouse. At one point in the speech, Rebbetzin Bitton pointed out how
            she had a brother with a terminal illness, and the sensitivity that
            he had towards others. How much more so should we have sensitivity
            towards our own spouses! Mixing laughter and true life stories, Mrs.
            Bitton brought the audience to their feet at the end of her lecture
            at Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Nachman Seltzer, author of 30 books, flew in from Israel to
            address the men. Along the lines of empathy, Rabbi Seltzer brought
            forth the story of Rachel and Yaakov in the Torah. Rachel cries out
            to Yaakov that she is childless and begs her husband to give her a
            child, citing that without children she cannot go on living. Yaakov
            tersely responds that he is not G-d, and cannot govern whether or
            not she can have children. Rabbi Seltzer pointed out that our sages
            chastise Yaakov for his lack of sensitivity in responding to Rachel.
            Hers was not a call to action, but rather a cry for empathy, for a
            caring ear to listen. Sometimes, Rabbi Seltzer pointed out, there is
            no real solution for a situation. But a loving and understanding
            response will often suffice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tandem of speakers were hosted in the Valley once again by Danny
            and Yocheved Gohari. Dr. Stoll presented them with a plaque in
            appreciation of their hosting all three 2018 shalom bayis lectures.
            Just as was the case in July, there was literally a packed house for
            both the women's and men's sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            There has been an overwhelming response to the 2018 lecture series
            on shalom bayis. Numerous people have reached out to us at My Shalom
            Bayis to express their heartfelt thanks for the lectures. People
            take notes, share them with friends, and discussions on the topics
            frequently flow for weeks after the events! All of the 2018 speakers
            have had people follow up with them on various aspects of shalom
            bayis.

            Intimacy: What Every Husband and Wife Needs To Know
          </p>
          <p>
            The theme for the July 2018 lectures was intimacy. This is a topic
            of great sensitivity, and we at My Shalom Bayis made sure to find
            the best speakers on the subject. A packed house of over 250 women
            filled the Adas Torah auditorium to hear Rochel Goldbaum of Denver
            deliver an emotional and informative speech on the topic. The speech
            was so well received that the question-and-answer period almost
            stretched to midnight! Listeners were encouraged to follow up with
            Rebbetzin Goldbaum, whose contact information was made available
            that evening. The buzz from the evening continued for the next
            several weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The men's session was lead by Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, the ruv of
            Congregation Shaarei Tefila and an experienced chosson (groom)
            teacher himself. Rabbi Kesselman gave a checklist of points that a
            man must fulfill in order to reach his potential. These were not
            just halachic (Jewish commandment) obligations, but also very
            practical tips on ;how to approach intimacy with one's wife. As per
            the previous night's lecture, there was a great follow-up session
            with the rabbi. Indeed, several people reached out to Rabbi
            Kesselman in the weeks after the talk to continue the discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Valley, Rebbetzin Goldbaum was received with as much warmth
            as her talk at Adas Torah. Hosts Danny and Yocheved Gohari opened
            their home to the women's talk as well as the men's lecture
            delivered by Rabbi Jonathan Rosenberg of Congregation Shaarey Zedek.
            Both lectures attracted a standing-room-only crowd with the same
            spirited response as the city lectures.

            Communicating with your spouse was the theme of the first set of My
            Shalom Bayis lectures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sunday, April 22nd, 2018 marked the initial talk featuring Rebbetzin
            Jackie Bitton speaking to a packed house of women at a private home
            in the Valley. The lecture was punctured by laughter, groans and
            copious note taking! Mrs. Bitton followed up that performance by
            speaking to a group of mikveh ladies the next afternoon and then
            delivered her showcase lecture to over 200 women at Adas Torah on
            Monday, April 23rd. Following the hard working Mrs. Bitton, was
            Rabbi Reuven Epstein, who spoke the very next evening, again at Adas
            Torah, to over 150 men. Rabbi Epstein riveted the audience with his
            meaningful stories and practical tips. Rabbi Epstein continued the
            next evening, Wednesday April 24th with a three hour slide show and
            lecture to singles at Adas Torah. The following Sunday, April 29th,
            Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, rav of Congregation Shaarei Tefila, gave an
            inspiring talk to the Valley men on how to affectuate proper shalom
            bayis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although the lectures were entertaining, their main message was
            educational. And that is the goal that My Shalom Bayis tries to
            achieve. The feedback from the events was off the charts! Please see
            the attached article from Jewish Home magazine that covered the
            events.
