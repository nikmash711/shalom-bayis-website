					<h2>April 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Communicating with your spouse was the theme of the first set of My Shalom Bayis lectures.</p>
					
					<p>Sunday, April 22nd, 2018 marked the initial talk featuring Rebbetzin Jackie Bitton speaking to a packed house of women at a private home in the Valley.  The lecture was punctured by laughter, groans and copious note taking!  Mrs. Bitton followed up that performance by speaking to a group of mikveh ladies the next afternoon and then delivered her showcase lecture to over 200 women at Adas Torah on Monday, April 23rd.  Following the hard working Mrs. Bitton, was Rabbi Reuven Epstein, who spoke the very next evening, again at Adas Torah, to over 150 men.  Rabbi Epstein riveted the audience with his meaningful stories and practical tips.  Rabbi Epstein continued the next evening, Wednesday April 24th with a three hour slide show and lecture to singles at Adas Torah.  The following Sunday, April 29th, Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, rav of Congregation Shaarei Tefila, gave an inspiring talk to the Valley men on how to affectuate proper shalom bayis.  </p>
					
					<p>Although the lectures were entertaining, their main message was educational.  And that is the goal that My Shalom Bayis tries to achieve.  The feedback from the events was off the charts!  Please see the attached article from Jewish Home magazine that covered the events. </p>

					<h2>July 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Intimacy: What Every Husband and Wife Needs To Know</p>
					<p>The theme for the July 2018 lectures was intimacy.  This is a topic of great sensitivity, and we at My Shalom Bayis made sure to find the best speakers on the subject.  A packed house of over 250 women filled the Adas Torah auditorium to hear Rochel Goldbaum of Denver deliver an emotional and informative speech on the topic.  The speech was so well received that the question-and-answer period almost stretched to midnight!  Listeners were encouraged to follow up with Rebbetzin Goldbaum, whose contact information was made available that evening.  The buzz from the evening continued for the next several weeks.
					</p>
					<p>The men's session was lead by Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, the ruv of Congregation Shaarei Tefila and an experienced chosson (groom) teacher himself.  Rabbi Kesselman gave a checklist of points that a man must fulfill in order to reach his potential.  These were not just halachic (Jewish commandment) obligations, but also very practical tips on ;how to approach intimacy with one's wife.  As per the previous night's lecture, there was a great follow-up session with the rabbi.  Indeed, several people reached out to Rabbi Kesselman in the weeks after the talk to continue the discussion.
					</p>
					<p>In the Valley, Rebbetzin Goldbaum was received with as much warmth as her talk at Adas Torah.  Hosts Danny and Yocheved Gohari opened their home to the women's talk as well as the men's lecture delivered by Rabbi Jonathan Rosenberg of Congregation Shaarey Zedek.  Both lectures attracted a standing-room-only crowd with the same spirited response as the city lectures.

					<h2>November 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Three Ways Of Keeping Your Love Alive</p>
					<p>Early November ushered in a bit of fall weather.  With the chill came a pair of warm lectures on the topic of "Three ways to keep your love alive".  Jackie Bitton, a girls' school principal in New York and a featured Ohr Naava speaker, gave a spirited talk to the women.  The overwhelming theme was the way one should show empathy for their spouse.  At one point in the speech, Rebbetzin Bitton pointed out how she had a brother with a terminal illness, and the sensitivity that he had towards others.  How much more so should we have sensitivity towards our own spouses!  Mixing laughter and true life stories, Mrs. Bitton brought the audience to their feet at the end of her lecture at Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills.  
					</p>
					<p>Rabbi Nachman Seltzer, author of 30 books, flew in from Israel to address the men.  Along the lines of empathy,  Rabbi Seltzer brought forth the story of Rachel and Yaakov in the Torah.  Rachel cries out to Yaakov that she is childless and begs her husband to give her a child, citing that without children she cannot go on living.  Yaakov tersely responds that he is not G-d, and cannot govern whether or not she can have children.  Rabbi Seltzer pointed out that our sages chastise Yaakov for his lack of sensitivity in responding to Rachel.  Hers was not a call to action, but rather a cry for empathy, for a caring ear to listen.  Sometimes, Rabbi Seltzer pointed out, there is no real solution for a situation.  But a loving and understanding response will often suffice.
					</p>
					<p>The tandem of speakers were hosted in the Valley once again by Danny and Yocheved Gohari.  Dr. Stoll presented them with a plaque in appreciation of their hosting all three 2018 shalom bayis lectures.  Just as was the case in July, there was literally a packed house for both the women's and men's sessions.
					</p>
					<p>There has been an overwhelming response to the 2018 lecture series on shalom bayis.  Numerous people have reached out to us at My Shalom Bayis to express their heartfelt thanks for the lectures.  People take notes, share them with friends, and discussions on the topics frequently flow for weeks after the events!  All of the 2018 speakers have had people follow up with them on various aspects of shalom bayis.
