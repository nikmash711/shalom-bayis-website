					<h2>April 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Communicating with your spouse was the theme of the first set of My Shalom Bayis lectures.</p>
					
					<p>Sunday, April 22nd, 2018 marked the initial talk featuring Rebbetzin Jackie Bitton speaking to a packed house of women at a private home in the Valley.  The lecture was punctured by laughter, groans and copious note taking!  Mrs. Bitton followed up that performance by speaking to a group of mikveh ladies the next afternoon and then delivered her showcase lecture to over 200 women at Adas Torah on Monday, April 23rd.  Following the hard working Mrs. Bitton, was Rabbi Reuven Epstein, who spoke the very next evening, again at Adas Torah, to over 150 men.  Rabbi Epstein riveted the audience with his meaningful stories and practical tips.  Rabbi Epstein continued the next evening, Wednesday April 24th with a three hour slide show and lecture to singles at Adas Torah.  The following Sunday, April 29th, Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, rav of Congregation Shaarei Tefila, gave an inspiring talk to the Valley men on how to affectuate proper shalom bayis.  </p>
					
					<p>Although the lectures were entertaining, their main message was educational.  And that is the goal that My Shalom Bayis tries to achieve.  The feedback from the events was off the charts!  Please see the attached article from Jewish Home magazine that covered the events. </p>

						<h1>HUNDREDS ATTEND SHALOM BAYIS LECTURE SERIES AT ADAS TORAH</h1>
						<h6>May 10, 2018</h6>
						<h6>Rebecca Klempner, Jewish Home LA</h6>
						<hr class = "style5">
						<p>Enthusiastic crowds crammed into two recent shalom bayis events at Adas Torah. Approximately 200 women attended a lecture by Jackie Bitton on April 23rd. On the 24th, 150 men attended given by Rabbi Reuven Epstein.</p>
						<p>The events were spearheaded by Dr. David Stoll, a strong believer in the importance of marriage education. “It’s something that is greatly needed in the community,” he says. “This was confirmed by my conversations with local rabbonim, therapists in the community, and everyday people.</p>
						<p>“We all know that every day we have to work on our avodas Hashem. We should never be satisfied with the level we are on. So too, every day we need to work on our marriages, and we should never be satisfied with the level we’re on. If our marriage is 5 or 6 stars out of 10, even 7 stars, why not aspire to 10? …Every day, we live a life connecting to Hashem, and every day we live a life connecting with our spouses.”</p>
						<p>Dr. Stoll looked around for stellar speakers on the topic and brought two to L.A. for the lecture series. Rebbetzin Jackie Bitton, who speaks frequently for Ohr Naava, offered an advice-filled lecture punctuated with both tearful moments and laugh-out-loud ones. According to Julie Iskowitz, who attended the event, “[Mrs.] Bitton encouraged each woman to create ‘a happy and positive home,’ to ‘squash the tension before it gets ugly,’ and she instructed each woman to ‘make what is important to one’s husband important to her.’”</p>
						<p>The following evening, Rabbi Epstein, who is an accountant by profession, provided real-life examples of how men can show their wives love, back away from confrontation, and see things from her point of view. He followed that with a lively question and answer period.</p>
						<p>Evey Liebow attended the women’s event and said, “I like that [Mrs. Bitton] had an outline of topics which was super clear and organized, and that she reviewed everything at the end. And she was well-spoken, with funny anecdotes that were engaging.”</p>
						<p>Jamie Kleinman agreed that Mrs. Bitton’s humor made the evening particularly enjoyable. She added, “What was really nice about it was that they had a women’s and a men’s class connected, on back-to-back evenings…shalom bayis can be much better with both parties educated.”</p>
						<p>Her husband, Tomer, attended the following evening’s program with Rabbi Epstein. “There aren’t many shalom bayisprograms for men, and I liked having the opportunity to attend.”</p>
						<p>Dr. Stoll hopes this is the just beginning of this shalom bayis project. “We’ll see what the feedback is from the event, then we’ll plan new programs based on what people say they want and need. We are very encouraged by the great showing we had.” Anyone who would like to assist with future events can contact Dr. Stoll by email at info@myshalombayis.com. </p>

					<h2>July 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Intimacy: What Every Husband and Wife Needs To Know</p>
					<p>The theme for the July 2018 lectures was intimacy.  This is a topic of great sensitivity, and we at My Shalom Bayis made sure to find the best speakers on the subject.  A packed house of over 250 women filled the Adas Torah auditorium to hear Rochel Goldbaum of Denver deliver an emotional and informative speech on the topic.  The speech was so well received that the question-and-answer period almost stretched to midnight!  Listeners were encouraged to follow up with Rebbetzin Goldbaum, whose contact information was made available that evening.  The buzz from the evening continued for the next several weeks.
					</p>
					<p>The men's session was lead by Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, the ruv of Congregation Shaarei Tefila and an experienced chosson (groom) teacher himself.  Rabbi Kesselman gave a checklist of points that a man must fulfill in order to reach his potential.  These were not just halachic (Jewish commandment) obligations, but also very practical tips on ;how to approach intimacy with one's wife.  As per the previous night's lecture, there was a great follow-up session with the rabbi.  Indeed, several people reached out to Rabbi Kesselman in the weeks after the talk to continue the discussion.
					</p>
					<p>In the Valley, Rebbetzin Goldbaum was received with as much warmth as her talk at Adas Torah.  Hosts Danny and Yocheved Gohari opened their home to the women's talk as well as the men's lecture delivered by Rabbi Jonathan Rosenberg of Congregation Shaarey Zedek.  Both lectures attracted a standing-room-only crowd with the same spirited response as the city lectures.

						<h1>Los Angeles – Hundreds of Attendees at Shalom Bayis Lectures</h1>
						<h6>July 27, 2018</h6>
						<h6>The Jewish Link</h6>
						<hr class = "style5">
						<p>A crowd of over 250 women were treated to an outstanding lecture on the topic of intimacy on Monday, July 16 at Congregation Adas Torah.  And, the following night, over 200 men assembled to receive another great lecture on the same topic.</p>
						<p>The events were arranged and sponsored by Dr. David Stoll, a local dermatologist.  Dr. Stoll initiated the series of shalom bayis lectures three months ago to benefit the entire community.  The initial pair of lectures drew hundreds of participants thus propelling Dr. Stoll to put together another similar event.</p>
						<p>This time, the topic was intimacy, a topic that is often glossed over in the orthodox Jewish community.  Dr. Stoll felt that it was time to address the topic in a modest but forceful way in an effort to provide guidance and answer lingering questions.  He sought out two of the top speakers on the subject – Rochel Goldbaum of Denver, Colorado who is a marriage counselor, kallah teacher and international lecturer was chosen to speak to the women.  She started off with a lecture Sunday night, July 15 in the Valley at a private home.  Not only was the audience mesmerized by the talk, but the question and answer period extended for hours after the formal lecture ended.  Mrs. Goldbaum followed up the next evening at Adas Torah to a packed auditorium with a similar response.</p>
						<p>Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, the rabbi of Congregation Shaarei Tefila of Los Angeles, was the choice to speak to the men.  In addition to being a synagogue rabbi, Kesselman is a renowned chosson teacher for soon-to-be-married men.  He enumerated seven points that a man must institute to create a solid marriage as the basis for establishing an intimate relationship with his wife.</p>
						<p>Together, Mrs. Goldbaum and Rabbi Kesselman provided much needed information for the married community at large.  The audience ranged from newlyweds to people married over 40 years!  There was something to be learned for everyone.  Dr. Stoll was encouraged by the great showing and plans to put together future events within the theme of shalom bayis.  “We really saw the entire orthodox Jewish community come together with this topic.  It underscores the need for further hadrachah (guidance) on a variety of topics within the shalom bayis genre,”  he stated.</p>

					<h2>November 2018</h2>
					<p class = "bold">Three Ways Of Keeping Your Love Alive</p>
					<p>Early November ushered in a bit of fall weather.  With the chill came a pair of warm lectures on the topic of "Three ways to keep your love alive".  Jackie Bitton, a girls' school principal in New York and a featured Ohr Naava speaker, gave a spirited talk to the women.  The overwhelming theme was the way one should show empathy for their spouse.  At one point in the speech, Rebbetzin Bitton pointed out how she had a brother with a terminal illness, and the sensitivity that he had towards others.  How much more so should we have sensitivity towards our own spouses!  Mixing laughter and true life stories, Mrs. Bitton brought the audience to their feet at the end of her lecture at Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills.  
					</p>
					<p>Rabbi Nachman Seltzer, author of 30 books, flew in from Israel to address the men.  Along the lines of empathy,  Rabbi Seltzer brought forth the story of Rachel and Yaakov in the Torah.  Rachel cries out to Yaakov that she is childless and begs her husband to give her a child, citing that without children she cannot go on living.  Yaakov tersely responds that he is not G-d, and cannot govern whether or not she can have children.  Rabbi Seltzer pointed out that our sages chastise Yaakov for his lack of sensitivity in responding to Rachel.  Hers was not a call to action, but rather a cry for empathy, for a caring ear to listen.  Sometimes, Rabbi Seltzer pointed out, there is no real solution for a situation.  But a loving and understanding response will often suffice.
					</p>
					<p>The tandem of speakers were hosted in the Valley once again by Danny and Yocheved Gohari.  Dr. Stoll presented them with a plaque in appreciation of their hosting all three 2018 shalom bayis lectures.  Just as was the case in July, there was literally a packed house for both the women's and men's sessions.
					</p>
					<p>There has been an overwhelming response to the 2018 lecture series on shalom bayis.  Numerous people have reached out to us at My Shalom Bayis to express their heartfelt thanks for the lectures.  People take notes, share them with friends, and discussions on the topics frequently flow for weeks after the events!  All of the 2018 speakers have had people follow up with them on various aspects of shalom bayis.
