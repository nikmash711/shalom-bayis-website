            <h1>HUNDREDS ATTEND SHALOM BAYIS LECTURE SERIES AT ADAS TORAH</h1>
            <h6>May 10, 2018</h6>

            <hr class="style5" />
            <p>
              Enthusiastic crowds crammed into two recent shalom bayis events at
              Adas Torah. Approximately 200 women attended a lecture by Jackie
              Bitton on April 23rd. On the 24th, 150 men attended given by Rabbi
              Reuven Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
              The events were spearheaded by Dr. David Stoll, a strong believer
              in the importance of marriage education. “It’s something that is
              greatly needed in the community,” he says. “This was confirmed by
              my conversations with local rabbonim, therapists in the community,
              and everyday people.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We all know that every day we have to work on our avodas Hashem.
              We should never be satisfied with the level we are on. So too,
              every day we need to work on our marriages, and we should never be
              satisfied with the level we’re on. If our marriage is 5 or 6 stars
              out of 10, even 7 stars, why not aspire to 10? …Every day, we live
              a life connecting to Hashem, and every day we live a life
              connecting with our spouses.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Stoll looked around for stellar speakers on the topic and
              brought two to L.A. for the lecture series. Rebbetzin Jackie
              Bitton, who speaks frequently for Ohr Naava, offered an
              advice-filled lecture punctuated with both tearful moments and
              laugh-out-loud ones. According to Julie Iskowitz, who attended the
              event, “[Mrs.] Bitton encouraged each woman to create ‘a happy and
              positive home,’ to ‘squash the tension before it gets ugly,’ and
              she instructed each woman to ‘make what is important to one’s
              husband important to her.’”
            </p>
            <p>
              The following evening, Rabbi Epstein, who is an accountant by
              profession, provided real-life examples of how men can show their
              wives love, back away from confrontation, and see things from her
              point of view. He followed that with a lively question and answer
              period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Evey Liebow attended the women’s event and said, “I like that
              [Mrs. Bitton] had an outline of topics which was super clear and
              organized, and that she reviewed everything at the end. And she
              was well-spoken, with funny anecdotes that were engaging.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie Kleinman agreed that Mrs. Bitton’s humor made the evening
              particularly enjoyable. She added, “What was really nice about it
              was that they had a women’s and a men’s class connected, on
              back-to-back evenings…shalom bayis can be much better with both
              parties educated.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Her husband, Tomer, attended the following evening’s program with
              Rabbi Epstein. “There aren’t many shalom bayisprograms for men,
              and I liked having the opportunity to attend.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Stoll hopes this is the just beginning of this shalom bayis
              project. “We’ll see what the feedback is from the event, then
              we’ll plan new programs based on what people say they want and
              need. We are very encouraged by the great showing we had.” Anyone
              who would like to assist with future events can contact Dr. Stoll

              Los Angeles – Hundreds of Attendees at Shalom Bayis Lectures
            </h1>
            <h6>July 27, 2018</h6>

            <p>
              A crowd of over 250 women were treated to an outstanding lecture
              on the topic of intimacy on Monday, July 16 at Congregation Adas
              Torah. And, the following night, over 200 men assembled to receive
              another great lecture on the same topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The events were arranged and sponsored by Dr. David Stoll, a local
              dermatologist. Dr. Stoll initiated the series of shalom bayis
              lectures three months ago to benefit the entire community. The
              initial pair of lectures drew hundreds of participants thus
              propelling Dr. Stoll to put together another similar event.
            </p>
            <p>
              This time, the topic was intimacy, a topic that is often glossed
              over in the orthodox Jewish community. Dr. Stoll felt that it was
              time to address the topic in a modest but forceful way in an
              effort to provide guidance and answer lingering questions. He
              sought out two of the top speakers on the subject – Rochel
              Goldbaum of Denver, Colorado who is a marriage counselor, kallah
              teacher and international lecturer was chosen to speak to the
              women. She started off with a lecture Sunday night, July 15 in the
              Valley at a private home. Not only was the audience mesmerized by
              the talk, but the question and answer period extended for hours
              after the formal lecture ended. Mrs. Goldbaum followed up the next
              evening at Adas Torah to a packed auditorium with a similar
              response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rabbi Moshe Kesselman, the rabbi of Congregation Shaarei Tefila of
              Los Angeles, was the choice to speak to the men. In addition to
              being a synagogue rabbi, Kesselman is a renowned chosson teacher
              for soon-to-be-married men. He enumerated seven points that a man
              must institute to create a solid marriage as the basis for
              establishing an intimate relationship with his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, Mrs. Goldbaum and Rabbi Kesselman provided much needed
              information for the married community at large. The audience
              ranged from newlyweds to people married over 40 years! There was
              something to be learned for everyone. Dr. Stoll was encouraged by
              the great showing and plans to put together future events within
              the theme of shalom bayis. “We really saw the entire orthodox
              Jewish community come together with this topic. It underscores the
              need for further hadrachah (guidance) on a variety of topics
              within the shalom bayis genre,” he stated.

              A pair of lectures on shalom bayis attracted hundreds of attendees
              on May 13 and 14 at Nessah Synagogue. The lectures, part of an
              ongoing series of talks on shalom bayis, were arranged by Dr.
              David Stoll, a local dermatologist with an interest in promoting
              marital harmony.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monday night, May 13 featured Mrs. Rivka Malka Perlman from
              Baltimore. Mrs. Perlman has an extensive background working in
              kiruv, and currently is a life coach guiding people to connect
              with their inner selves. Mrs. Perlman really had the audience
              spellbound for her hour talk. She began with the question of “Who
              am I? What do I bring to this marriage?” She then emphasized the
              role of emunah, stating that marriage is made up of three partners
              – the husband, the wife, and Hashem himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Addressing the reality of today’s Jewish woman, Mrs. Perlman
              described the impossible task of working, running a household, and
              being the perfect wife and mother. Perfect, she emphasized, does
              not exist. And women should not mentally beat themselves up if
              they are not perfect. Self accusations and lies against one’s
              self, she related, not only are harmful, but contrary to halacha.
              Mrs. Perlman encouraged people to delight in the goodness of life,
              be it food, sunshine or simply taking a shower. The attendees were
              riveted to their seats to the very end of the lecture. Many women
              stayed afterward to speak with Mrs. Perlman. She can be reached at
              itsrivkamalka@gmail.com.

              Rabbi Efraim Stauber came all the way from Israel to address the
              men on Tuesday night, May 14. Rabbi Stauber’s most recent passion
              is the development of an online community called eKehilla.com,
              replete with lectures, divrei torah and connecting people from all
              types of backgrounds in the online kehilla. He is also a certified
              marriage counselor. Rabbi Stauber spoke to the men about analyzing
              the underlying reasons why we act the way we do with our spouses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Men, he pointed out, need respect whereas women need to feel safe
              and not abandoned. Trust is the biggest element of marriage
              because it means that we are exposing our needs and inadequacies
              to someone who will keep that information guarded. Rabbi Stauber
              encouraged the men to work on a better understanding of themselves
              as well as their spouses. He can be reached at eKehilla.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both speakers also spoke in the Valley at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
              Azzi and Alia Silkoff. The Valley crowds were just as enthusiastic
              with the lectures staying way beyond their speaking times to
              address questions from the audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Stoll hopes to put together more lectures on the general topic
              of shalom bayis in the future. If you are interested in more
              information, please email info@myshalombayis.com. For those who

              In a continuing series of lectures on shalom bayis (marital
              harmony), the Los Angeles community was treated to several great
              speakers on the subject. The topic this time around was”Tools and
              Tips from the Wisdom of Torah”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Michal Horowitz, a highly sought after speaker from New York,
              graced the audiences in the Valley and Beverly Hills with her warm
              and heart felt stories. Mrs. Horowitz is no stranger to Los
              Angeles, having spoken last year at the YULA shabbaton and the OU
              west coast convention. A speaker in great demand, she was
              recruited to speak in Denver, Fort Lee, Five Towns and Los Angeles
              just in the month of November alone!
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking first at Congregation Shaarey Zedek in the Valley on
              Sunday November 17th and then at Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills
              on November 18th, Mrs. Horowitz related a number of Torah based
              examples of how we should relate to our spouses. She pointed out
              that there are only two places in the Torah where the words “lo
              tov” (not good) are used. Now, one can think of many unpleasant
              events that the Torah relates, but, yet there are only two
              instances where this phrase is used. The first is in relation to
              Adam who, before the creation of his wife Chava, was all alone in
              the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second instance was when Moshe Rabbainu had taken upon himself
              to judge every single case of dispute among the Jewish nation.,
              His father in law, Yisro, related to him that it is “lo tov” that
              he assumes all of the responsibility alone, but he should delegate
              authority to others to judge the lesser cases. In each case the
              phrase “lo tov” is followed by the use of the word alone. In
              Adam’s case, it was physical loneliness. He did not have a
              partner. In the case of Moshe, it was quite the opposite, he was
              inundated with work and was anything but alone.. How, then, can we
              say that Moshe was alone?

              Mrs. Horowitz pointed out that even if we are in a relationship
              such as marriage, we can still feel alone and isolated from our
              spouses. Lack of communication, lack of feeling are signs of
              loneliness in a marriage. Just going through the motions of
              earning a living and raising children is quite a painful existence
              without a connection to our spouses. That is why the Torah singles
              out loneliness as the prime example of “lo tov”.

              Mrs. Horowitz brought in other Torah based examples of how to
              communicate and appreciate our spouses despite the troubles and
              travails that encompass our lives.

              Rabbi Jonathan Rosenberg delivered a passionate lecture in his own
              shule, Shaarey Zedek, on Monday November 18. In a smooth and
              calming manner, Rabbi Rosenberg quoted various Torah sources for
              maintaining shalom bayis, as issue that he deals with on a
              constant basis as a congregational rabbi. His well received talk
              ran over the allotted time due to the voluminous material that he
              presented. But all participants stayed to the very end due to the
              great presentation and subject matter.

              The next evening, November 19, Rabbi Dov Heller enthralled his
              audience at Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills by enumerating the 4
              Torah principles of shalom bayis: namely; chesed, love, joy and
              patience.Rabbi Heller, a practicing psychotherapist, quoted the
              Ramchal (Rabbi Moshe Luzzato) in stating that one should give love
              and avoid giving pain to others. In quoting many rabbinic
              authorities of past and present, Rabbi Heller weaved in many
              practical suggestions based on his years of family therapy. Make
              time to be together, be a good listener, do not be self centered
              by just focusing on what is bothering you, He emphasized the
              importance of coming home from work in a good mood and leaving
              your troubles at the office. As with the other speakers, the
              audience was riveted to their seats even as the talk ran overtime.
